Description: Extendable set of tools to facilitate training, tuning and testing 
    of tree-based models.
    Designed to quickly produce a good baseline model, that can be further tuned manually.
    The primary value generated by the forester package is to promptly build a baseline for other, 
    more complex models. 
    This package extends the prototype developed by the `ModelOriented/forester` project.
    Results are explainers consistent with `DrWhy` universe.
    Explanations from the `DALEX` library can be used without any further preparation.
    As tree models are trained, the explanations developed by the `TreeShap` method can be used. 
    So resulting explanations have a quick feedback loop that can leverage Navigated Data Exploration.
